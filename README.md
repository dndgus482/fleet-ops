# Introduction

This project is designed to execute scheduled jobs on remote servers **without installing any agent** on the target machines.

The system connects to remote servers over SSH, triggers commands or scripts according to a schedule, and collects the execution results.  
It aims to provide a lightweight and flexible way to manage remote tasks without the complexity of deploying and maintaining additional software on each server.

The core goals of this project are:
- Simplify remote task execution
- Minimize setup overhead (agentless)
- Offer a lightweight and extendable framework for managing scheduled jobs
- Continuously expand features to support more use cases
